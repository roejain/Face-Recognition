# Face-Recognition
This is a web-based application which identifies the victims of child trafficking.


Modules used: 
* opencv
* numpy
* face-recognition
* streamlit
* os


How it works?
* The database contains photographs of missing children and encodings of these faces are stored by the application.
* If any person finds a child to be suspected as a victim of trafficking maybe on traffic lights selling newspapers etc, she/he can check easily using the application     and immediately report to the police.
* If the application identifies the victim by name, it implies that the child has been reported missing and needs to be secured.
